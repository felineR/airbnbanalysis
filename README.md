# airbnbanalysis

This project is created as part of Udacity's nanodegree program "Data Scientist". It is the first project of this program and is named "Write a Data Science Blog Post".
The project contains two Jupyter Notebooks:
- The first Jupyter Notebook AirBnBDataPreparation contains all data preparations.
- The second Jupyter Notebook AirBnBDataScience contains three questions and the findings made.

The three main questions posed by this project are:
1. Which listing attributes have the highest impact on the listing's price?
2. How do the prices of superhost's listings differ from the prices of regular host's listings?
3. How well can we predict a listing's price?
